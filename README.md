# PdeESN
Library of functions used to execute experiments for evaluating the interpretability of Echo State Networks (ESNs). ESNs are trained in the task of predicting the evolution of a nonlinear system (the Lorenz System) and the weights of their readout layers are interpreted using Principal Component Analysis. An example runner for an experiment is encluded in <Experiment.py>.

The results of these experiments are described in this paper: https://openreview.net/forum?id=coaSxusdBLX.
